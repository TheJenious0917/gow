# Headless host

This is where GOW really shines!

We'll take care of running and configuring:
- A desktop environment 
- With audio 
- Inside Docker 
- That can support HW acceleration
- And with a streaming solution that:
    - It's low latency
    - Supports keyboard, mouse and joypads
    - Can be HW accelerated
- **!!!**

On top of that foundation layer you can run most of the GUI applications out there and even games!
